-=o=- Full changelog of Fallout 13 -=o=-

It took us more than a year to assemble all the fixes, features, graphics and sounds together.
We couldn't afford automatic change logging or other fancy features.
Instead you can have this odd and barely readable changelog to satisfy your curiosity.
If you are not sure if you can figure out all that messy stuff, notable features of F13 may also be found at our devblog:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout13/

Part I: Fallout 13 Build Specific Features
The unique content created by Fallout 13 team and our dear friends who wanted to contribute to the project on their own.

#1 - Ivan_Mrr

Ivan is pro-level graphic artist, who spared some time to create awesome sprites for our project.

*Entirely new cryo.
*Cool new tables!
*Additional ladder icon in structures.
*trash.dmi and some trash like barrels and tires for sure.
*More wall and floor types, as the floors didn't fit in the floors.dmi we have added the floors2.dmi and floors3.dmi
*Tons of decals in decals.dmi (wasteland, asphalt and vault decals too.)
*wasteland_doors.dmi
*obstacles.dmi : metal fences, blue and yellow handrails - all these are coded in already.
*Cactus and tree parts in wasteland.dmi
*Wasteland trees in deadtrees.dmi
*gear.dmi - Vault door with open and closing animation sequences.

#2 - WalterJe

WalterJe is one of notable Space Station 13 graphic artists, whose content is present in builds of various communities including /tg/ Station 13 and all which use TG codebase, Animus Station and Tau Ceti Station as well.
And he created quite some sprites for F13 specifically.

*Motion tracker with sound. Coded in the build.

*Makeshift knife, machete, frying pan, hammer and golf club in weapons.dmi
*Wasteland motorcycle with animations and a dune buggy vehicles. They work just fine in-game, easy spawn, both include sounds for engine start.

#3 - BartNixon

Bart is the one who started to create the thing two years ago for a global event, but it has turned into a separate codebase.
Being a designer in real life, he created various sprites from a scratch to fit in Fallout 13 universe.

*Created glowing mushrooms and added them to wasteland.dmi
*Filled decal.dm with various decorative decal instances along with the ones from Mr. R.
*Passports in bureaucracy.
*Better Nuka Cola. Now with code!

Bart's code stuff:

*Created f13_example_0 map to provide a mapping example. 
*Turned Central Command updates into Radio Broadcasts and changed the general system to work with this one. Morse code is strong in this one.
*Total hair overhaul! Added different hairstyles and facial hair, renamed quite some hairstyles and fixed the sprites. Adapted the all the lists according to the type and style of hair.

*Coded the specific Fallout 13 clothing - can be discovered searching for "f13" in item spawn search.
*Restored legacy body bags.
*New text formating style for ingame chat, and new colors for admin chat etc.

All vehicle icons are now called small_vehicles.dmi and medium_vehicles.dmi
*Cops can be dirty too - allowed Security Officer and Detective to be an antag.

#4 - WB

WB was the very first coder from /tg/ Station 13 to provide his help with the project. 

*New loading screen system - smooth and random swap of lobby images Fallout style.
*Holodisks with animations when played.

#5 - Nienhaus

Our dear friend from Urist McStation, one of the most notable Space Station 13 spriters, who created content for most of SS13 codebases. His content can be found everywhere from /tg/ Station 13 to Baystation 12 and all the derivatives of them.

*Wasteland piano sprites.
*Mr.Handy and Mr.Gutsy!
*Barrel cactus at wasteland.dmi and barrel cactus fruit in food.dmi

*Added various clothing for characters, pre-War outfits and such.
*Also added content from other of his projects, mafia and cowboy stuff.

#6 - MrSnapwalk

We wish there were more people who have heard of MrSnapwalk, aside from Baystation 12 or UristMcStation. Skilled and creative spriter with impressive music talent.

*Stimpack and Med-X (syringes), Radaway (bloodpack), Hydra, Psycho, Jet, Rebound (syringes), Mentats, Turbo, rad-x, steady (chemical)
*Replaced syringes to a med-x similar variant. 
*Classic fallout terminal in computers.dmi
*Protectron, Robobrain and Eyebot robots!

#7 - A3lex33

Some people believe this particular coder is the future of the project. Sure thing he got some skills, and the rumors can be true. If he won't stop coding the cool stuff of course. 

*obstacles.dm for some wasteland related objects.
*Coded fences (can cut through the specific parts of these with wirecutters), and fence doors. 
*Total remake of NanoUI style! Now it's more of an 80's computer terminal.

A great visual artist from the type of traditional arts, future programmer a one who contributed the very first animal mobs to the project.

*Mole rat and cazador icons.
*Some awesome female haircuts. Coded in the build.

This man knows how to sprite some fancy clothing. And so he did fill the F13 with quality content to the edge.

A beginner level spriter, a person who is responsible for the project's revival after a year long freeze.
Special thanks to you BlackJack22.

*New glass shards.

#11 - Murmillo

*Predator mob.

#12 - Lydee

A person who made the whole Fallout 13 possible by inspiring some people to begin the project in the first place.

*Holodisk icons with animation sequence.
*Classic military stimpack.

#13 - Alexlox

A spriter who could create so much more good things if he wanted to.

*We have two guitars now. Which is great, for some Lonesome Drifters.

#14 - Harvester

An artist with a strong desire to make his own version of Fallout 13 the way he wants it to be.

#15 - DoctorWho08

Shady entity with specific style and behaviour, but nevertheless - it is here, and it can do some good deeds.

#16 - Incoming5643

Someone who doesn't even know of Fallout 13 (yet), but sure can join our lovely team any time. 

*Added large metal boxes of RobCo with code (brilliant for mob-containment purposes)

Part II: Manual Fixes
It's the code selectively ported from /tg/ Station 13 and other various sources we don't account as our own and don't claim any rights for it's creation.
But without these, the build could not exist on it's own.
Most of the following are more Space Station 13 related, but some of them do really affect F13 as well.
Original creators of Manual Fix code are listed along with the changes they made.
Notable features have comments stating the change of mechanics or provide the explanation of their in-game use.

#1 - KorPhaeron

ATTENTION!

Pick two, fire both! On harm intent only, and a slight delay between off_hand shots.

*Nerfed ultimate stealth weapon (fork) - now it will show attack animation when trying to target eyes.
*Removed the excess janitors bucket from the Nuke ops bathroom.

Also the 375 ammo got rekt (in code), and replaced with .44 Magnum.
Do you feel lucky now, punk?

tkdrg: You click "mark datum" in the dropdown and then open game panel and click "duplicate marked datum" . Also the dropdown isn't easily spammable for badm- I mean, for events.

*Floor level objects will now be protected from explosions until they are exposed.
(Note for the last referenced feature: It didn't break the game but it seems it doesn't work.)

#4 - RemieRichards

*Get_turf_pixel() is now more accurate:
Returns a turf closer to the center in even multiples of world.icon_size (64,128, etc.)
Handles irregular (non-world.icon_size sized objects) better.
Now handles Matrix X/Y shifts.
*Made ATMOS SPEED ZOOM ZOOM WEEE optimised two loops that Dunc missed.

ATTENTION!
*Added custom maploader.
Admin with +Debug can safely spawn map piece 30x30 tiles, using a load map template command from Debug menu. Map spawns in a "green" highlited zone with various objects, items and structures for different purposes, if the map was included into the special folder in the build.
Use this to load f13_example_0.dmm for instance.
ONCE AGAIN:
Admins with +DEBUG can now Load map files in the _map/templates folder where they (or their ghost) is standing.

*Also improved the speed of the for()loops in the maploader procs. Removed assumptions that the coordinates exist (NO MORE RUNTIMES AT MAP EDGES WOOO!)

#9 - The-Albinobigfoot

*Nuclear Operatives can buy no-slips again.

#10 - Thunder12345

ATTENTION!
*Made holoparasites vulnerable to EMPs
Manufacturing cost concerns have resulted in newly produced holoparasites suffering a significant vulnerability to EMPs. Crews are now recommended to engage with the station's ion rifle.
Alternative solution to nerfing holoparasites, instead of increasing the cost, to give them a significant vulnerability.
Every hit from the ion rifle multiplies the damage_transfer of the stand by a factor of 1.15, and forces it to recall. Forced recalls will not respect the usual cooldown.
